# difflist
A tool for wordlist generation etc.


# Why whould i use that???

-If you can't find the correct password with the generated wordlist before, you will create another one. But there will be a lot of used password combination from your first attack. difflist fixes that. it generates the wordlist which has no used password combinations.


I am planning to code multi-worlist support.

# Usage
python3 difflist.py -f <firstwl> -s <secondwl>
